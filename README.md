Hosted under https://www.worlddriven.org

World driven introduces a contribution based weighted voting system
for merging of pull requests. As soon as you contribute to a project, you get a share or
responsibility for the progress of the project.

## Develop

Run `gunicorn --workers=1 --worker-class=flask_sockets.worker server:app --chdir src`.

As backend a mongodb server is used and can be configured via: `MONGODB_URI`
environment variable.

For github oauth feature provide `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`,
callback url is `/github-callback`.
Set Session secret as `SESSION_SECRET` initial a random string.

Run tests with: `pytest`

### Install via docker compose

Copy `.env-example` to `.env` and add your environment variables.
```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Configuration

To allow different configurations on different repositories you can place a
`.worlddriven.ini` (see `.worlddriven.ini-example`) in the root of your
repository and adapt the values.
When worlddriven checks new Pull Requests it fetches the `.worlddriven.ini` from
your default branch (fetching from the Pull Request could be a security issue)
and applies the configuration.

## Frontend

The frontend has three views:

- `/` the frontpage
- `/dashboard` a dashboard with an overview of the repositories and a button to
enable World Driven for the repository
- `/:org/:repo/pull/:pull_number` A detailed calculation breakdown for the pull
request

To be able to easily work on the different views test endpoints are available:

- `/test/dashboard` - for the dashboard
- `/test/:org/:repo/pull/:pull_number` - for the pull request view

## Production environment

The World Driven auto-merge service is hosted on heroku, tested via CircleCI,
merge via World Driven and automatically deployed.
